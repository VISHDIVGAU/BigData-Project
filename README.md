# BigData-Project
Just as a small amount of sugar or salt can make a cake taste very different, a very short lockdown can trigger a chain reaction of interesting atmospheric effects and cause the everyday temperatures to plummet or rise. That is exactly our problem statement: We have made an attempt to analyze the effect of these lockdowns on everyday temperatures.
As we all know the pandemic has caused a lot of busy cities around the world to enforce lockdowns. 

In 2020, New York City went into a major lockdown, forcing thousands of people to stay back at home, which triggered a chain reaction, causing the traffic system of NYC to see an unbelievable reduction in the flow of vehicles in the city. Naturally the result of this is clear, cleaner and unpolluted air. There are proofs for this in newspaper articles about how this impacted the Air Quality Index. The good consequence that resulted from this is lowering of everyday temperatures as well. 

In this project, we aim to use the techniques taught to us in this class to analyze the temperature data of NYC, and use this data to train a machine learning model and predict the future temperatures and how the future temperature varies based on whether the city is under a lockdown or not.
